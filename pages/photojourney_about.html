        <p>For as long as I can remember, I've been an avid learner, reader and storyteller.
         Albeit an arduous process, my journey has been shaped by a deep curiosity of the world around me
        as well as a desire to gather a diverse array of tales that promote connection, transport those who witness it to a new realm,
        and perhaps even take inspiration from my own experiences. In this photo essay, I utilize a camera's capability to instantly capture 
        a moment in time during several trips between Los Angeles' Union Station and San Jose's Diridon Station.
        I do hope you find some level of enjoyment as you embark on this digital journey.</p>
